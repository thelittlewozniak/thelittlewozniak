Hi all! My name is Nathan. I'm a Developer Evangelist who try to make the world better and more aware of new technologies!
How do I try to make that?



## MIC
As a Developer Evangelist at the [MIC](https://mic-belgique.be/), I work a lot with new technologies to show the power of these to developers or SMEs.
To make that, my colleagues and I make demos, talks,events,... 

### HITW
One of our biggest event is [the Hack In The Woods](https://hackinthewoods.be/).

The HITW is a festival for developers. During a weekend, 1000 developers will code and help NGOs for a better world. 
They will develop projects that can help the NGOs on the ground, in a logistic part or innovative projets. 
To have better ideas and a cool ambiance, we are inside a wood inside an ecological farm.

But, HITW is also an event where you can learn things. To make that possible, we have 2 tracks of talks to help people learn more on new things or on things that they already know.

### MICFM

MICFM is a monthly podcast where we talk about news for developers. There's also every time a guest who come to explain his project and co-animate the podcast. 
By this podcast, we keep members of the community of the MIC informed but also everyone who want to be informed. We also want to show to everyone that there's a lot of cool 
projects in wallonia.

## SPACEY

At the beginning, SpaceY was just a joke but now, it's a community. 
A community of young developers that focuses on delivering opensource projects based on new technologies. 
These projects are from different areas, answer or redefine different needs and spontaneously break implicit standards in order to show the developer community that we can still improve current applications but also create new things !

the website is [SpaceY](https://www.wearespacey.com/).
