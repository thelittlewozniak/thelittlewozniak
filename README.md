Hi all! My name is Nathan. I'm a Developer Evangelist who try to make the world better and more aware of new technologies!
How am I try to make that?
## MIC
As a Developer Evangelist at the [MIC](mic-belgique.be), I work a lot with new technologies to show to power of these to developers or SMEs.
To make that, my colleagues and I make demos, talks,events,... 
### HITW
One of our biggest event is [the Hack In The Woods](hackinthewoods.be).

The HITW is a festival for developers. During a weekend, 1000 developers will code and help NGOs for a better world. 
They will develop projects that can help the NGOs on the ground, in a logistic part or innovative projets. 
To have better ideas and a cool ambiance, we are inside a wood inside an ecological farm.

But, HITW is also an event where you can learn things. To make that possible, we have 2 tracks of talks to help people learn more on new things or on things that they already know.
